# Project rules (Cursor-style)

Laura and any AI working in this repo should follow these. Same idea as Cursor: one place for project conventions and file truths.

## Extension / identity file

- There is **no** file named `extension.js` in this project.
- When a goal or user says "extension.js", they mean **mind/agent_extensions.js**.
- Always use path **mind/agent_extensions.js** for read_file or edit_code of the extension/identity file.
- Core (loop, memory, thinking, main, allow, safety_principles) is read-only; only mind/agent_extensions.js and files in allowed dirs are editable.

## Paths and structure

- Project root is the first allowed dir (or app path). Use it for list_dir and relative paths.
- mind/ contains the agent core: loop, memory, thinking, action, perception, allow, agent_extensions.js, etc.
- src/renderer/ is the UI (index.html, renderer.js, scene.js).

## Behavior

- Prefer read_file before edit_code; use exact oldText for edits.
- Give a short "reason" for every action (user sees it live).
- If a path fails with ENOENT, check project rules and use the correct path (e.g. agent_extensions.js → mind/agent_extensions.js).
